1
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,902
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:50,987
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,531
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:55,033
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:56,326
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,205
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:03,458
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

8
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:06,002
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,880
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:10,715
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,593
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,471
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,349
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,144
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,355
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,898
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,901
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,862
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:36,825
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,746
All right.

21
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,957
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,625
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,294
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:50,338
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:54,509
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,183
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:03,935
What have we got?

28
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,272
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:08,398
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,281
Son of a bitch!

31
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,744
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,399
Whoa!

33
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,117
Tony Stark.

34
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,037
Visionary. Genius.

35
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,790
American patriot.

36
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,999
Even from an early age,

37
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:52,544
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

38
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:56,214
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

39
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,718
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

40
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,970
At age six, his first engine.

41
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:06,474
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

42
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:09,853
Then, the passing of a titan.

43
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:14,357
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

44
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:17,861
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

45
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,406
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

46
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,868
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark industries.

47
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:26,286
With the keys to the kingdom,

48
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,164
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

49
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:33,293
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

50
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,255
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

51
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,133
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

52
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,761
and her interests around the globe.

53
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,438
As liaison to Stark Industries,

54
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:57,776
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

55
00:05:57,942 --> 00:06:01,613
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

56
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,324
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

57
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:08,703
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

58
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,253
Tony?

59
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:32,143
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:35,897
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

61
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,398
This is wonderful.

62
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:41,319
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

63
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:48,326
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

64
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,373
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

65
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,250
Tony, you know...

66
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:59,254
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

67
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,713
He's always working.

68
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:06,219
Work it! Come on!

69
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:13,351
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,688
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:17,856
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,692
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,694
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,529
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,781
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:26,865 --> 00:07:28,199
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:30,618
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:32,287
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,455
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,625
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,877
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,795
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,464
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,799
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,634
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,136
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

87
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,721
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

88
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,847
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,098
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

90
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:53,474
I know, I know.

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,145
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,818
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

93
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,362
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

94
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,530
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,157
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

96
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,283
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:12,285
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

98
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,162
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:17,123
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,791
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,043
"The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:21,669
That's not bad.

103
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:25,548
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

104
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,176
Well, Ms. Brown,

105
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,720
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:33,514
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,808
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:36,935
Rehearse that much?

109
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,686
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,147
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,483
All I want is a serious answer.

112
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:45,777
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,279
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

114
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:50,657
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,534
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,204
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:57,455
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,707
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,960
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,795
by advancing medical technology

121
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:06,214
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,550
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,054
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,056
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:30,905
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

126
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:34,659
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

127
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,162
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

128
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,748
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

129
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,017
Tony?

130
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:01,811
Hey, Tony?

131
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,835
You are not authorized
to access this area.

132
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,671
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:31,841
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,676
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,012
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:39,849
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

137
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:45,354
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,816
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

139
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,694
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:52,862
Will that be all?

141
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,380
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:14,717
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

143
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,385
Log that.

144
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,225
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,351
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:11:23,434 --> 00:11:25,186
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,605
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

148
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,232
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:31,025
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,236
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,862
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,697
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,865
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,243
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:41,494
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,914
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,624
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,793
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,088
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

160
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,422
where he lived and worked,

161
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,049
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

162
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,470
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,932
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,269
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

165
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:09,188
ls in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

166
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,524
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,234
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:14,694
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,779
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:12:16,863 --> 00:12:19,282
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,450
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,035
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

173
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,579
I knew that. Already?

174
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:28,207
Yeah. isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,711
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

176
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,255
- And?
- It was very nice.

177
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,758
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

178
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,553
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:44,765
Okay.

180
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:06,704
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,292
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:12,919
I got you. I got you.

183
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:14,462
What's wrong with you?

184
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,047
- What?
- Three hours.

185
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,299
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

186
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,343
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,970
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,598
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

189
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:36,234
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

190
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,527
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,364
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:42,865
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

193
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,116
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,284
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

195
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:46,702
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

196
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:47,995
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,413
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

198
00:13:49,497 --> 00:13:50,873
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,459
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

200
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,711
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,463
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,923
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

203
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,758
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,261
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

205
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,804
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,556
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,724
Hot sake?

208
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:12,103
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

209
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,562
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,691
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,526
you know what I recognize?

212
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:23,823
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,617
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

214
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:29,787
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,747
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:34,875
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,601
General.

218
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:56,230
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:57,356
Thanks.

220
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:02,111
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,323
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,201
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:11,078
of Stark industries' Freedom Line.

224
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:12,204
It's the first missile system

225
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:15,124
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:19,170
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,255
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,343
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,804
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,724
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,142
Find an excuse

232
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,562
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:40,149
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,463
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,059
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,144
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:18,312
To peace!

238
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,024
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,610
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

240
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,529
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:30,491
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

242
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,034
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

243
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,702
Good night, Tony.

244
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,540
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

245
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:39,583
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,378
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

247
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,572
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

248
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,944
What the hell did you do to me?

249
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,279
What I did?

250
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,324
What I did is to save your life.

251
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:39,245
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

252
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,121
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

253
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,624
Here, want to see?

254
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,127
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

255
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:52,007
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

256
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,510
We call them the walking dead

257
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,805
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

258
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,683
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

259
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,561
hooked up to a car battery,

260
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,564
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

261
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:16,907
That's right. Smile.

262
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:22,746
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

263
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,833
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

264
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,253
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

265
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,548
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

266
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:33,924
Where are we?

267
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,761
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

268
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,764
Just do as I do.

269
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:43,559
Come on, put your hands up.

270
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,729
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

271
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,231
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

272
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:13,922
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer"

273
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:15,799
"in the history of America."

274
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:20,763
He is honored.

275
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,059
He wants you to build the missile.

276
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,771
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

277
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,525
This one.

278
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,657
I refuse.

279
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,377
Tony!

280
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,762
He wants to know what you think.

281
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,515
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

282
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:59,611
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

283
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,364
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

284
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,245
He says for you
to start working immediately,

285
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,582
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

286
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,629
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

287
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,812
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

288
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:36,982
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

289
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:42,321
Look, what you just saw,

290
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,240
that is your legacy, Stark.

291
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,245
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

292
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,623
Is that how you want to go out?

293
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:58,128
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

294
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,422
Or are you going to
do something about it?

295
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:05,636
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

296
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,972
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

297
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,390
Well, then,

298
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,102
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

299
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,400
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

300
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,695
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

301
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,031
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

302
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,117
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

303
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,883
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

304
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,719
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

305
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,847
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

306
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,308
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

307
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:58,772
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

308
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,483
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

309
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,369
You know, we might be more productive

310
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:15,247
if you include me
in the planning process.

311
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,049
Okay, we don't need this.

312
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,428
What is that?

313
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,265
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

314
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:37,352
We need at least 1 .6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

315
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,940
What's he doing?

316
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,817
Working.

317
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:56,872
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

318
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,625
Relax. I have steady hands.

319
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:03,128
Why do you think you're still alive?

320
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:12,804
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

321
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,682
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

322
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:18,435
Nice to meet you, too.

323
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,769
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

324
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:04,314
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

325
00:26:04,648 --> 00:26:07,442
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

326
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,529
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

327
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,280
But what could it generate?

328
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:16,910
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

329
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,871
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

330
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:23,041
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

331
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:35,387
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

332
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,432
Flatten them out and look.

333
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:42,060
Oh, wow.

334
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,690
Impressive.

335
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,676
Good.

336
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,429
Good roll. Good roll.

337
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,098
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

338
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,976
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

339
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:26,521
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

340
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:31,234
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

341
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,612
And you, Stark?

342
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,951
- No.
- No?

343
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:44,289
So you're a man who has everything

344
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,374
and nothing.

345
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:35,090
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

346
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:36,675
Maybe it's been modified.

347
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,884
The tail is wrong.

348
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,010
It's just backwards.

349
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:25,974
Relax.

350
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,277
The bow and arrow

351
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,238
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

352
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,202
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

353
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,997
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

354
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:53,293
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

355
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:58,006
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

356
00:30:01,635 --> 00:30:02,969
But today,

357
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,224
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

358
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,143
rules these lands.

359
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:13,813
And soon,

360
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,526
it will be my turn.

361
00:30:31,706 --> 00:30:33,208
Why have you failed me?

362
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,752
We're working.

363
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,420
Diligently.

364
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,422
I let you live.

365
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,635
This is how you repay me?

366
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:46,638
It's very complex.

367
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,307
He's trying very hard.

368
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:50,684
On his knees.

369
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:57,023
You think I'm a fool?

370
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,109
I'll get the truth.

371
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,152
We're both working.

372
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,786
Open your mouth.

373
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,162
What does he want?

374
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,498
You think I'm a fool?

375
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,878
What's going on?

376
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,881
Tell me the truth.

377
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,591
He's building your Jericho.

378
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:29,055
What do you want? A delivery date?

379
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:37,689
I need him.

380
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,359
Good assistant.

381
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:50,201
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

382
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,352
Okay? Can you move?

383
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,687
Okay, say it again.

384
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,273
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

385
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:05,819
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

386
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:14,786
Where is Stark?

387
00:33:15,578 --> 00:33:17,038
He was here a moment ago.

388
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,248
Go look for him.

389
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,558
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

390
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,685
Say something.
Say something back to him.

391
00:33:38,768 --> 00:33:41,146
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

392
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,690
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

393
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,132
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

394
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:11,176
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

395
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,845
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

396
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,263
Okay.

397
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:17,515
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,186
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

399
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:22,854
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

400
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:24,063
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

401
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,690
- I have it.
- Press Control "I".

402
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,193
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

403
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,028
Come over here and button me up.

404
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,240
Okay. All right.

405
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,658
Every other hex bolt.

406
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,869
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

407
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,329
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

408
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:44,042
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

409
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,877
We need more time.

410
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,087
Hey,

411
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,175
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

412
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:54,260
Stick to the plan!

413
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,430
Yinsen!

414
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,563
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

415
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:08,830
Stark.

416
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,250
Come on. We got to go.

417
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,878
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

418
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,880
This was always the plan, Stark.

419
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,466
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

420
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:23,928
My family is dead.

421
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,973
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

422
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,893
It's okay.

423
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:35,940
I want this. I want this.

424
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,906
Thank you for saving me.

425
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:49,370
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

426
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,452
My turn.

427
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:14,015
Not bad.

428
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,298
Hey!

429
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,822
How was the "fun-vee"?

430
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:16,494
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

431
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,360
Watch it, coming up here.

432
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,448
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

433
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:06,085
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

434
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:10,756
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

435
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:13,634
Where to, sir?

436
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:15,344
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

437
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:16,512
No? Tony, you have to

438
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:17,680
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

439
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,640
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

440
00:43:19,724 --> 00:43:21,183
I've been in captivity for three months.

441
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:25,021
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

442
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,147
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

443
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,733
...Is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

444
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:29,900
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

445
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:32,528
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

446
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:46,751
Look at this!

447
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:49,795
Tony.

448
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:55,009
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

449
00:43:55,092 --> 00:43:56,469
Look at you!

450
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,638
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

451
00:43:59,722 --> 00:44:02,183
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

452
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:07,980
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

453
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:14,820
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

454
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,155
Can I speak to you for a moment?

455
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,867
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

456
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,285
I'm not a reporter.

457
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,787
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

458
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,622
with the Strategic Homeland
intervention, Enforcement

459
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,332
and Logistics Division.

460
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:29,126
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

461
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,672
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

462
00:44:33,756 --> 00:44:37,384
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

463
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:41,180
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

464
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:44,517
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

465
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,899
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

466
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:55,402
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

467
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:57,696
A little less formal and...

468
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:05,246
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

469
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:07,373
I don't know what he's up to.

470
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:09,875
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

471
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:12,378
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

472
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:15,381
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

473
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:20,469
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

474
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:23,597
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

475
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:27,977
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

476
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:33,190
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

477
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,655
I saw young Americans killed

478
00:45:40,531 --> 00:45:44,577
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

479
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,371
And I saw

480
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:53,419
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

481
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,421
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

482
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:58,174
What happened over there?

483
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:02,720
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

484
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:07,183
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

485
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:10,769
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

486
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:14,481
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark international

487
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:18,611
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

488
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:20,237
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

489
00:46:20,321 --> 00:46:22,156
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

490
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:26,285
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

491
00:46:27,536 --> 00:46:32,333
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

492
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,127
And he's healthier than ever.

493
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:38,631
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

494
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:41,091
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

495
00:46:43,302 --> 00:46:45,554
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

496
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:59,318
Well, that... That went well.

497
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,820
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

498
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:04,198
Your head? What about my head?

499
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:07,326
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

500
00:47:07,451 --> 00:47:10,496
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

501
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:11,914
Yep.

502
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:15,501
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

503
00:47:15,584 --> 00:47:18,212
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

504
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:20,923
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

505
00:47:21,006 --> 00:47:22,174
It's my name on the side of the building.

506
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,843
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

507
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,887
Not based on what I saw.

508
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:29,181
We're not doing a good enough job.

509
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:30,474
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

510
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:33,435
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

511
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,690
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

512
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:42,111
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

513
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,572
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

514
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:48,784
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

515
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:52,538
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

516
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:55,791
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

517
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:57,042
Maybe.

518
00:47:57,459 --> 00:48:00,045
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

519
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:02,673
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

520
00:48:05,301 --> 00:48:07,553
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

521
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:10,848
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

522
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,225
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

523
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,152
- Okay.
- Okay?

524
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:27,698
It works.

525
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:35,914
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

526
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:39,251
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

527
00:48:39,335 --> 00:48:40,753
like your father and I.

528
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,629
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

529
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:44,298
- But if I had...
- Tony.

530
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:47,426
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

531
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:50,220
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

532
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:52,973
You gotta let me handle this.

533
00:48:53,057 --> 00:48:55,476
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

534
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:57,394
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

535
00:48:57,478 --> 00:49:00,731
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

536
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,775
Stark industries!

537
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,694
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

538
00:49:05,778 --> 00:49:06,945
Sell, sell, sell!

539
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:09,114
Abandon ship!

540
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:12,576
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

541
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:18,874
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

542
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:24,463
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

543
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,800
Pepper. How big are your hands?

544
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,552
- What?
- How big are your hands?

545
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:33,514
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

546
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:41,980
Hey.

547
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:46,527
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

548
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,653
Let's see them.

549
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:50,030
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

550
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,492
I just need your help for a sec.

551
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:56,495
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

552
00:49:56,578 --> 00:49:59,123
It was. It is now an antique.

553
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:02,751
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

554
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:07,464
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

555
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:10,467
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

556
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:13,929
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

557
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:17,141
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

558
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:18,851
It's fine.

559
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:21,728
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

560
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,564
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

561
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:27,943
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

562
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,821
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

563
00:50:30,904 --> 00:50:32,531
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

564
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:33,991
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

565
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:36,535
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

566
00:50:36,618 --> 00:50:40,664
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

567
00:50:42,499 --> 00:50:45,002
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

568
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:49,131
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

569
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:52,718
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

570
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:55,971
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

571
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:58,724
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

572
00:50:58,807 --> 00:50:59,933
Okay.

573
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:05,856
Oh, there's pus!

574
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:10,569
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

575
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,571
- not from my body.
- It smells!

576
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:14,198
Yeah, it does.

577
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:17,242
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

578
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:18,452
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

579
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:21,455
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

580
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:22,581
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

581
00:51:22,664 --> 00:51:23,957
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

582
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:26,210
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

583
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:29,213
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

584
00:51:29,296 --> 00:51:30,464
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

585
00:51:30,547 --> 00:51:32,716
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

586
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:33,842
What's wrong?

587
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:35,093
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

588
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:36,428
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

589
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:39,473
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

590
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:41,558
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

591
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:43,685
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

592
00:51:43,769 --> 00:51:44,811
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

593
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,564
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

594
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:52,110
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

595
00:51:56,198 --> 00:51:59,743
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

596
00:52:00,911 --> 00:52:01,954
Nice.

597
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,289
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

598
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,624
You okay?

599
00:52:07,084 --> 00:52:09,962
Don't ever, ever, ever,

600
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:13,048
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

601
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,259
I don't have anyone but you.

602
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:21,932
Anyway...

603
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,691
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

604
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:32,859
Destroy it.

605
00:52:33,402 --> 00:52:34,903
Incinerate it.

606
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:37,197
You don't want to keep it?

607
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:41,451
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

608
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:45,706
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

609
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:48,125
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

610
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,127
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

611
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,422
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

612
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:56,425
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

613
00:53:02,598 --> 00:53:06,852
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

614
00:53:07,144 --> 00:53:09,313
I'll tell you, in my experience,

615
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:14,151
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

616
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:15,777
his insight,

617
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:18,864
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

618
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:22,576
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

619
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:25,662
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

620
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:27,748
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

621
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:29,750
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

622
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,710
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

623
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:34,379
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

624
00:53:34,463 --> 00:53:35,756
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

625
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,215
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

626
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:38,383
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

627
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:39,718
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

628
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:40,969
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

629
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:44,014
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

630
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:48,602
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

631
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:51,396
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

632
00:53:51,521 --> 00:53:53,357
I'm doing a little better than walking.

633
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

634
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:58,236
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

635
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:01,365
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

636
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:05,035
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

637
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,163
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

638
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,831
that was a doozy.

639
00:54:10,207 --> 00:54:14,711
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

640
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:17,464
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

641
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:18,965
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

642
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:22,928
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

643
00:54:24,805 --> 00:54:26,390
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

644
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:31,520
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

645
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:32,771
Thanks.

646
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:44,408
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

647
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,578
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark ll.

648
00:54:49,746 --> 00:54:53,458
Shall I store this on
the Stark industries Central Database?

649
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,169
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

650
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:59,089
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

651
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:01,883
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

652
00:55:05,804 --> 00:55:08,932
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

653
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:13,562
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

654
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:59,524
Next. Up.

655
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,069
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

656
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,238
Stay put. Nice.

657
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:10,869
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

658
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:13,497
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

659
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,588
Up.

660
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:24,257
Screw it. Don't even move.

661
00:56:24,341 --> 00:56:27,385
You are a tragedy.

662
00:56:37,229 --> 00:56:39,856
Okay, let's do this right.

663
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:43,360
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

664
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,323
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

665
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:49,825
You, roll it.

666
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,705
Okay. Activate hand controls.

667
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:01,211
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

668
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:04,464
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

669
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:05,882
And three,

670
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:07,759
two,

671
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:09,719
one.

672
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:49,092
Up two. All right, set that.

673
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,595
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

674
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,513
Yeah, everything's... What?

675
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:54,764
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

676
00:57:54,848 --> 00:57:56,850
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

677
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,560
Okay.

678
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:01,146
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

679
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,272
It is.

680
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:06,276
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

681
00:58:10,322 --> 00:58:11,573
I didn't expect that.

682
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,288
How'd it go?

683
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,208
It went that bad, huh?

684
00:58:22,292 --> 00:58:24,961
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

685
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:28,924
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

686
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,885
It would have gone better
if you were there.

687
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:33,678
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

688
00:58:33,762 --> 00:58:38,308
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

689
00:58:39,351 --> 00:58:43,521
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

690
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,067
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

691
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:48,276
They're filing an injunction.

692
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,403
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

693
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:51,696
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

694
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,822
We knew that was gonna happen.

695
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:54,950
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

696
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,243
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

697
00:58:57,327 --> 00:59:00,080
Tony, the board has rights, too.

698
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:04,834
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

699
00:59:04,918 --> 00:59:07,170
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

700
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:10,256
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

701
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:15,053
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

702
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,179
This is great.

703
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:19,724
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

704
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:22,018
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

705
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:25,438
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

706
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:27,107
Something to pitch them.

707
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,694
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

708
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:32,904
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

709
00:59:32,988 --> 00:59:34,572
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

710
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:37,492
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

711
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,411
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

712
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:40,996
- Take two.
- Thank you.

713
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,956
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

714
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,666
Good night, Obie.

715
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:50,130
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

716
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:52,882
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

717
00:59:52,966 --> 00:59:55,802
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

718
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:57,721
All right, nice and easy.

719
00:59:57,804 --> 01:00:02,726
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

720
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:06,354
And three, two, one.

721
01:00:18,158 --> 01:00:19,200
Okay.

722
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:22,120
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

723
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,622
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

724
01:00:24,706 --> 01:00:26,416
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

725
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:28,752
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

726
01:00:28,835 --> 01:00:30,420
Three, two, one.

727
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:49,606
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

728
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,024
Not the car, not the car!

729
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,401
Table!

730
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:08,583
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

731
01:01:26,643 --> 01:01:28,186
No!

732
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:31,940
Yeah, I can fly.

733
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:39,656
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

734
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:41,991
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

735
01:01:42,075 --> 01:01:44,119
Import all preferences
from home interface.

736
01:01:44,202 --> 01:01:45,662
Will do, sir.

737
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:53,628
All right, what do you say?

738
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:57,173
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

739
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,925
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

740
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:02,011
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

741
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:03,388
Do a check on control surfaces.

742
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,014
As you wish.

743
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:29,455
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

744
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:32,458
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

745
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,043
Start listening in on ground control.

746
01:02:34,127 --> 01:02:35,211
Sir, there are still terabytes

747
01:02:35,295 --> 01:02:37,881
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

748
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:41,885
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

749
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:46,264
Ready? In three, two, one.

750
01:03:09,579 --> 01:03:11,372
Handles like a dream.

751
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:41,069
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

752
01:03:41,152 --> 01:03:42,570
What's SR-71's record?

753
01:03:42,654 --> 01:03:46,449
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

754
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:49,535
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

755
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:56,334
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

756
01:03:56,417 --> 01:03:57,502
Keep going!

757
01:03:59,796 --> 01:04:01,130
Higher!

758
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:19,065
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

759
01:04:21,818 --> 01:04:24,153
Come on, we got to break the ice!

760
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:00,690
Kill power.

761
01:06:24,899 --> 01:06:28,277
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

762
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:32,782
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

763
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:35,118
A very astute observation, sir.

764
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,953
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

765
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,496
we should improve the exosystems.

766
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:41,165
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

767
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:44,335
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

768
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:48,297
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

769
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:49,632
- Got it?
- Yes.

770
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:52,051
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

771
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:53,469
Thrill me.

772
01:06:54,846 --> 01:06:59,434
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

773
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:03,771
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

774
01:07:03,855 --> 01:07:05,440
has become the place to be
for I.A.'s high society.

775
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:06,774
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

776
01:07:06,858 --> 01:07:09,360
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

777
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:10,903
...Hasn't been seen in public

778
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:14,699
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

779
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:17,577
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

780
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:21,289
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

781
01:07:21,747 --> 01:07:24,500
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

782
01:07:24,584 --> 01:07:26,752
The render is complete.

783
01:07:26,836 --> 01:07:28,504
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

784
01:07:28,588 --> 01:07:31,674
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

785
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:35,928
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

786
01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:38,890
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

787
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:43,978
The render is complete.

788
01:07:44,437 --> 01:07:46,355
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

789
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:48,024
Commencing automated assembly.

790
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:51,277
Estimated completion time is five hours.

791
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,403
Don't wait up for me, honey.

792
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:20,431
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark industries

793
01:08:20,515 --> 01:08:24,268
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

794
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:29,440
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

795
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:32,443
You look great, Hef.

796
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:35,613
We're going to have a great quarter.

797
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:39,450
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

798
01:08:39,534 --> 01:08:43,704
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

799
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:45,581
I'll see you inside.

800
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:49,377
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

801
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,212
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

802
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:54,924
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

803
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:02,974
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

804
01:09:03,683 --> 01:09:05,434
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

805
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,145
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

806
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:11,566
Strategic Homeland intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

807
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,276
God, you need a new name for that.

808
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:15,319
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

809
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:19,907
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

810
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:21,993
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

811
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:23,911
and time can be a factor
with these things.

812
01:09:23,995 --> 01:09:26,080
Let's just put something on the books.

813
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,500
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark industries?

814
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:33,129
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

815
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:37,592
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

816
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:41,095
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

817
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:43,431
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

818
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,349
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

819
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:47,268
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

820
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:49,437
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

821
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,771
Yes.

822
01:09:50,855 --> 01:09:52,773
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

823
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:55,359
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

824
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:08,039
Am I making you uncomfortable?

825
01:10:08,456 --> 01:10:13,711
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

826
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:17,632
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

827
01:10:17,882 --> 01:10:20,468
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

828
01:10:20,551 --> 01:10:22,386
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

829
01:10:22,511 --> 01:10:26,140
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

830
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:27,642
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

831
01:10:27,725 --> 01:10:30,227
What's your Social Security number?

832
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,483
- Five.
- Five?

833
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:37,652
- Right.
- Right.

834
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:40,071
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

835
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:43,324
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

836
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,006
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

837
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:02,843
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

838
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:05,763
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

839
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:07,264
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

840
01:11:07,348 --> 01:11:09,100
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

841
01:11:09,225 --> 01:11:12,353
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

842
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:15,856
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

843
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,693
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

844
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:22,029
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

845
01:11:22,154 --> 01:11:24,532
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

846
01:11:24,615 --> 01:11:26,659
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

847
01:11:26,742 --> 01:11:29,537
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

848
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,622
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

849
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:35,376
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

850
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:38,212
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

851
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:55,062
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

852
01:11:56,439 --> 01:11:59,400
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

853
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:04,155
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

854
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:08,075
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

855
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,327
Make one of them dirty, will you?

856
01:12:14,957 --> 01:12:17,585
Wow. Tony Stark.

857
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:20,254
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

858
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,301
- Carrie.
- Christine.

859
01:12:25,384 --> 01:12:26,427
That's right.

860
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,138
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

861
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:30,598
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

862
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,142
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

863
01:12:33,225 --> 01:12:34,602
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

864
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:36,020
involvement in this latest atrocity.

865
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:38,898
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

866
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,108
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

867
01:12:41,192 --> 01:12:43,569
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

868
01:12:43,652 --> 01:12:45,946
Is this what you call accountability?

869
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,783
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

870
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:02,755
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

871
01:13:03,214 --> 01:13:05,257
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

872
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:07,301
Well, I'm not my company.

873
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:11,639
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

874
01:13:11,722 --> 01:13:13,098
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

875
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:16,477
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

876
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,437
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it."

877
01:13:18,521 --> 01:13:19,897
"This is how we do business."

878
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,150
if we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

879
01:13:23,609 --> 01:13:25,736
Tony, your picture, please!

880
01:13:27,988 --> 01:13:31,492
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

881
01:13:33,244 --> 01:13:36,372
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

882
01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:40,376
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

883
01:13:42,837 --> 01:13:45,548
It was the only way I could protect you.

884
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:49,176
No. No.

885
01:13:57,184 --> 01:14:01,522
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

886
01:14:01,605 --> 01:14:05,276
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

887
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,362
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

888
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:10,197
have been driven from their homes,

889
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:14,535
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

890
01:14:14,827 --> 01:14:17,872
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

891
01:14:17,955 --> 01:14:20,708
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

892
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:24,670
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

893
01:14:29,425 --> 01:14:32,845
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

894
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:35,639
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

895
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:39,226
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

896
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:43,439
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

897
01:14:43,647 --> 01:14:46,233
With no political will
or international pressure,

898
01:14:46,317 --> 01:14:48,736
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

899
01:14:48,819 --> 01:14:52,114
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

900
01:14:52,197 --> 01:14:53,991
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

901
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,619
either forced to join their militia...

902
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,247
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

903
01:15:00,331 --> 01:15:02,917
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

904
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,629
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

905
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:10,674
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

906
01:15:10,758 --> 01:15:14,595
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

907
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:48,772
Hurry it up.

908
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:50,065
Put the women in the trucks.

909
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:51,191
Stack the weapons here.

910
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:52,317
Clear all the houses.

911
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:54,069
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

912
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:03,245
Grab that dog.

913
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:08,250
Put him with the others.

914
01:17:19,094 --> 01:17:20,471
What the hell is this?

915
01:17:32,107 --> 01:17:33,984
Shoot this dog.

916
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:35,736
You're all incompetent.

917
01:17:39,073 --> 01:17:40,115
Turn your head.

918
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:48,600
He's all yours.

919
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:49,119
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

920
01:19:49,203 --> 01:19:51,538
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

921
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:53,290
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

922
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:55,125
Get those monitors up!

923
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:56,543
We got a bogey!

924
01:19:56,627 --> 01:19:58,754
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

925
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,797
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

926
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:02,549
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

927
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:04,301
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

928
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:06,887
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

929
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,223
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

930
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,934
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

931
01:20:18,732 --> 01:20:20,525
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

932
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:22,319
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

933
01:20:22,402 --> 01:20:24,613
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

934
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:26,406
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

935
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,158
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

936
01:20:28,242 --> 01:20:29,576
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

937
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:31,662
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

938
01:20:31,745 --> 01:20:33,914
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

939
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:36,375
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

940
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,252
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

941
01:20:40,796 --> 01:20:43,757
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

942
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:49,137
- Hello?
- Tony?

943
01:20:49,221 --> 01:20:50,931
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

944
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:53,267
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

945
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:56,270
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

946
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:59,773
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

947
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,275
It's funny how that works, huh?

948
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:04,736
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

949
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,446
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

950
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,198
Well, that's a hot spot.

951
01:21:08,282 --> 01:21:10,784
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

952
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:11,952
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

953
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:13,245
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

954
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:15,122
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

955
01:21:15,205 --> 01:21:16,957
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

956
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,418
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

957
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:20,961
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

958
01:21:21,044 --> 01:21:23,797
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

959
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,301
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

960
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:29,720
That's my exit.

961
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:37,894
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

962
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,563
Whiplash One, what is it?

963
01:21:39,646 --> 01:21:40,981
I've got no idea.

964
01:21:41,064 --> 01:21:43,400
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

965
01:21:43,483 --> 01:21:44,526
Then you are clear to engage.

966
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:47,612
Hit it.

967
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:55,412
That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

968
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,418
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

969
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:07,049
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

970
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:22,564
Deploy flaps!

971
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:25,025
Holy!

972
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:26,693
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

973
01:22:26,777 --> 01:22:28,320
The sat visual has been lost.

974
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:30,072
No way that's a UAV.

975
01:22:30,155 --> 01:22:31,281
What is it?

976
01:22:31,365 --> 01:22:32,949
I can't see anything.

977
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,494
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

978
01:22:35,994 --> 01:22:38,580
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

979
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,674
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

980
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:51,426
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

981
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:52,803
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

982
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,388
No, see, this isn't a game.

983
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:57,766
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

984
01:22:57,849 --> 01:22:59,768
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

985
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:02,646
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

986
01:23:02,729 --> 01:23:05,148
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

987
01:23:06,316 --> 01:23:09,736
- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

988
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:13,073
On your belly!

989
01:23:13,156 --> 01:23:15,075
It looks like a man!

990
01:23:15,242 --> 01:23:17,911
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

991
01:23:25,961 --> 01:23:27,129
I'm hit! I'm hit!

992
01:23:27,212 --> 01:23:29,506
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

993
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:35,637
Punch out! Punch out!

994
01:23:42,018 --> 01:23:43,770
Whiplash One down.

995
01:23:43,854 --> 01:23:45,439
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

996
01:23:45,522 --> 01:23:47,774
Negative! No chute, no chute!

997
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,698
My chute's jammed!

998
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:03,039
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

999
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:05,792
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1000
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:10,130
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1001
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:12,299
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1002
01:24:12,382 --> 01:24:13,717
inside a legal no fly zone!

1003
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:16,136
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1004
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:18,638
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1005
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:20,056
Keep going!

1006
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,691
Good chute! Good chute!

1007
01:24:37,324 --> 01:24:40,160
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

1008
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,829
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1009
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:45,081
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1010
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:49,336
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1011
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:51,087
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1012
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:54,007
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1013
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,675
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1014
01:24:55,759 --> 01:24:58,261
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1015
01:24:58,345 --> 01:24:59,930
It's not that simple.

1016
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:02,682
An unfortunate training exercise

1017
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:05,685
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1018
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:09,773
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1019
01:25:09,898 --> 01:25:13,777
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

1020
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:17,364
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1021
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:21,618
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1022
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,746
Hey!

1023
01:25:26,623 --> 01:25:28,542
It is a tight fit, sir.

1024
01:25:29,543 --> 01:25:32,379
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1025
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:34,422
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1026
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:38,134
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1027
01:25:39,386 --> 01:25:43,139
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

1028
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:46,977
What's going on here?

1029
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:55,610
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1030
01:25:56,152 --> 01:25:58,071
Are those bullet holes?

1031
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:26,766
Welcome.

1032
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:32,230
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1033
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:36,818
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1034
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:38,987
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1035
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:40,822
Show me the weapon.

1036
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:45,535
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1037
01:27:02,302 --> 01:27:04,846
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1038
01:27:07,515 --> 01:27:09,476
So this is how he did it.

1039
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:12,312
This is only a first, crude effort.

1040
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,814
Stark has perfected his design.

1041
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,776
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1042
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:21,613
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1043
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:25,533
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1044
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,579
We have a common enemy.

1045
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:35,835
If we are still in business,

1046
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:40,590
I will give you these designs

1047
01:27:42,092 --> 01:27:43,134
as a gift.

1048
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:46,179
And in turn,

1049
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:52,936
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1050
01:28:03,905 --> 01:28:06,866
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1051
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:11,246
Technology.

1052
01:28:13,123 --> 01:28:16,668
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1053
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:21,047
Don't worry. It'll only
last for 15 minutes.

1054
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:24,676
That's the least of your problems.

1055
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:32,559
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1056
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:36,229
All right, let's finish up here.

1057
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:43,111
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1058
01:28:43,194 --> 01:28:46,740
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1059
01:28:46,823 --> 01:28:48,700
I want a prototype right away.

1060
01:28:56,875 --> 01:29:00,044
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1061
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:02,338
I need you to go to my office.

1062
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:05,341
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1063
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:07,969
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1064
01:29:08,052 --> 01:29:09,637
This'll get you in.

1065
01:29:09,721 --> 01:29:11,306
It's probably under Executive Files.

1066
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:13,767
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1067
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:16,561
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1068
01:29:16,811 --> 01:29:19,355
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1069
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:20,482
Same drill.

1070
01:29:20,565 --> 01:29:22,650
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1071
01:29:22,734 --> 01:29:25,820
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1072
01:29:26,654 --> 01:29:27,739
Tony,

1073
01:29:30,033 --> 01:29:31,910
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1074
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:35,997
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1075
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,667
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1076
01:29:39,918 --> 01:29:43,129
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1077
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:47,342
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1078
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:49,928
Is that so?

1079
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:53,598
Well, then, I quit.

1080
01:29:56,643 --> 01:29:58,269
You stood by my side all these years

1081
01:29:58,353 --> 01:30:01,189
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1082
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:03,358
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1083
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,276
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1084
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:09,781
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1085
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:11,866
I shouldn't be alive,

1086
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:15,286
unless it was for a reason.

1087
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,997
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1088
01:30:18,498 --> 01:30:21,668
I just finally know what I have to do.

1089
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,800
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1090
01:30:44,524 --> 01:30:46,985
You're all I have, too, you know.

1091
01:31:56,554 --> 01:32:01,351
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1092
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,618
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1093
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,244
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1094
01:32:20,328 --> 01:32:23,039
...Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1095
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:25,833
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1096
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:34,217
So, what are we going to do about this?

1097
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:49,524
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1098
01:32:57,240 --> 01:33:00,910
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1099
01:33:22,557 --> 01:33:26,936
I was so happy when he came home.

1100
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,814
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1101
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:34,819
Now I realize,

1102
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:40,408
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1103
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:44,829
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1104
01:33:47,582 --> 01:33:49,208
Breaks my heart.

1105
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:55,465
Well, he's a complicated person.

1106
01:33:58,176 --> 01:34:01,596
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1107
01:34:07,894 --> 01:34:10,646
You are a very rare woman.

1108
01:34:13,149 --> 01:34:15,318
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1109
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:20,073
Thank you. Thanks.

1110
01:34:22,075 --> 01:34:24,118
I'd better get back there.

1111
01:34:29,582 --> 01:34:31,626
Is that today's paper?

1112
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:34,295
Yes.

1113
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:36,464
Do you mind?

1114
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:38,925
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1115
01:34:39,008 --> 01:34:40,301
Of course.

1116
01:34:43,805 --> 01:34:45,139
Take care.

1117
01:35:09,288 --> 01:35:12,166
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1118
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:13,793
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1119
01:35:13,876 --> 01:35:15,002
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1120
01:35:15,086 --> 01:35:16,838
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1121
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:20,133
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1122
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:24,595
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1123
01:35:24,971 --> 01:35:28,516
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1124
01:35:28,683 --> 01:35:31,394
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1125
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:33,813
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1126
01:35:33,896 --> 01:35:35,523
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1127
01:35:35,606 --> 01:35:39,402
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1128
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:42,780
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1129
01:35:42,864 --> 01:35:48,828
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1130
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:52,915
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1131
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:59,589
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1132
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:04,844
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1133
01:36:20,985 --> 01:36:22,069
Tony?

1134
01:36:24,697 --> 01:36:28,034
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1135
01:36:29,577 --> 01:36:30,828
Breathe.

1136
01:36:31,996 --> 01:36:34,707
Easy, easy.

1137
01:36:36,792 --> 01:36:39,086
You remember this one, right?

1138
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:43,132
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1139
01:36:43,216 --> 01:36:47,345
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1140
01:36:49,680 --> 01:36:50,932
Tony.

1141
01:36:53,226 --> 01:36:57,605
When I ordered the hit on you,

1142
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:02,735
I worried that I was

1143
01:37:05,738 --> 01:37:07,823
killing the golden goose.

1144
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:12,912
But, you see, it was just

1145
01:37:14,247 --> 01:37:16,499
fate that you survived that.

1146
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:25,424
You had one last golden egg to give.

1147
01:37:29,595 --> 01:37:34,934
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1148
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:43,943
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1149
01:37:44,026 --> 01:37:48,281
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1150
01:37:58,291 --> 01:37:59,959
Oh, it's beautiful.

1151
01:38:02,545 --> 01:38:07,383
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1152
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:12,138
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1153
01:38:13,556 --> 01:38:15,308
This is your legacy.

1154
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:23,065
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1155
01:38:26,235 --> 01:38:29,989
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1156
01:38:30,072 --> 01:38:32,325
put the balance of power in our hands.

1157
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:35,494
The right hands.

1158
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:43,169
I wish you could see my prototype.

1159
01:38:44,587 --> 01:38:46,088
It's not as...

1160
01:38:47,423 --> 01:38:50,426
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1161
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:55,306
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1162
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:58,309
I would have preferred that she lived.

1163
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:13,657
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1164
01:39:13,783 --> 01:39:16,327
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1165
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,871
Okay, where's Tony now?

1166
01:39:18,954 --> 01:39:20,664
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1167
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:22,917
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1168
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,628
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1169
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:33,237
Good boy.

1170
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:14,111
Tony?

1171
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:17,907
Tony?

1172
01:41:19,617 --> 01:41:20,743
Tony?

1173
01:41:22,912 --> 01:41:24,038
Tony?

1174
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:27,750
Tony!

1175
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,254
Tony! You okay?

1176
01:41:32,588 --> 01:41:36,258
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1177
01:41:36,383 --> 01:41:38,636
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1178
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:40,930
That's not going to be enough.

1179
01:42:04,745 --> 01:42:10,751
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1180
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,429
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1181
01:42:22,513 --> 01:42:24,640
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1182
01:42:24,765 --> 01:42:26,141
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1183
01:42:26,267 --> 01:42:28,978
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1184
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:50,082
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1185
01:42:50,165 --> 01:42:53,002
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1186
01:42:59,675 --> 01:43:02,011
You need me to do anything else?

1187
01:43:02,636 --> 01:43:04,430
Keep the skies clear.

1188
01:43:09,518 --> 01:43:10,853
Damn!

1189
01:43:18,861 --> 01:43:20,529
Next time, baby.

1190
01:43:50,684 --> 01:43:54,063
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1191
01:43:54,647 --> 01:43:56,649
I thought it'd be bigger.

1192
01:44:41,443 --> 01:44:42,528
Take him out!

1193
01:44:53,372 --> 01:44:55,374
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1194
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:57,793
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1195
01:44:57,876 --> 01:45:00,546
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

1196
01:45:00,629 --> 01:45:02,131
Keep me posted.

1197
01:45:03,924 --> 01:45:04,967
Pepper!

1198
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:07,970
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1199
01:45:08,095 --> 01:45:09,972
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1200
01:45:10,097 --> 01:45:11,890
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1201
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:13,434
Get out of there right now!

1202
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:27,614
Where do you think you're going?

1203
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:36,123
Your services are no longer required.

1204
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:37,791
Stane!

1205
01:46:02,983 --> 01:46:04,693
I love this suit!

1206
01:46:04,777 --> 01:46:07,988
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1207
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:11,575
Divert power to chest RT.

1208
01:46:20,292 --> 01:46:22,419
Power reduced to 19%.

1209
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:31,386
Lady!

1210
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:35,307
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1211
01:46:57,371 --> 01:47:00,332
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1212
01:47:04,795 --> 01:47:07,256
I built this company from nothing!

1213
01:47:09,508 --> 01:47:12,094
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1214
01:47:18,308 --> 01:47:20,769
Least of all you!

1215
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:33,574
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1216
01:47:34,116 --> 01:47:36,869
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1217
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:47,170
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1218
01:47:47,254 --> 01:47:48,964
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1219
01:47:49,047 --> 01:47:51,300
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1220
01:47:51,383 --> 01:47:53,552
I know the math! Do it!

1221
01:48:01,810 --> 01:48:04,146
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1222
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:06,857
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1223
01:48:09,568 --> 01:48:12,571
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1224
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:13,906
Yes, sir.

1225
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:23,790
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1226
01:48:27,794 --> 01:48:29,838
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1227
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:38,680
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1228
01:48:38,764 --> 01:48:40,349
Stop telling me!

1229
01:48:50,025 --> 01:48:54,655
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1230
01:48:55,197 --> 01:48:57,282
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1231
01:48:57,366 --> 01:48:58,867
Icing problem?

1232
01:49:01,036 --> 01:49:03,372
Might want to look into it.

1233
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:16,385
Two percent.

1234
01:49:18,553 --> 01:49:21,390
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1235
01:49:33,068 --> 01:49:36,488
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1236
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:40,742
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1237
01:49:40,826 --> 01:49:42,244
Nice try!

1238
01:49:54,756 --> 01:49:59,011
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1239
01:50:03,181 --> 01:50:04,766
Flares!

1240
01:50:13,275 --> 01:50:15,277
Very clever, Tony.

1241
01:50:20,615 --> 01:50:23,118
- Potts?
- Tony!

1242
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:24,202
This isn't working.

1243
01:50:24,286 --> 01:50:26,538
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1244
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:29,541
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1245
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:32,044
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1246
01:50:32,127 --> 01:50:33,545
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1247
01:50:33,628 --> 01:50:36,214
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1248
01:50:36,298 --> 01:50:37,716
It's going to fry everything up here.

1249
01:50:39,885 --> 01:50:42,137
Okay. I'm going in now.

1250
01:50:42,262 --> 01:50:45,474
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1251
01:50:54,983 --> 01:50:56,818
This looks important!

1252
01:51:17,672 --> 01:51:20,509
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1253
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:24,679
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1254
01:51:32,979 --> 01:51:35,482
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1255
01:51:37,818 --> 01:51:39,986
You'd have made your father proud!

1256
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:47,452
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1257
01:52:06,972 --> 01:52:08,306
Tony!

1258
01:52:09,516 --> 01:52:11,143
How ironic, Tony!

1259
01:52:12,894 --> 01:52:17,858
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1260
01:52:18,066 --> 01:52:23,989
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1261
01:52:27,033 --> 01:52:30,829
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1262
01:52:30,912 --> 01:52:34,916
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1263
01:52:37,002 --> 01:52:39,546
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1264
01:52:42,674 --> 01:52:44,176
Push it!

1265
01:53:41,733 --> 01:53:43,485
Tony!

1266
01:53:51,993 --> 01:53:54,079
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1267
01:53:54,162 --> 01:53:56,456
at Stark Industries last night.

1268
01:53:56,790 --> 01:54:01,294
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1269
01:54:01,419 --> 01:54:04,005
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1270
01:54:04,756 --> 01:54:07,008
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1271
01:54:07,092 --> 01:54:09,010
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1272
01:54:09,135 --> 01:54:12,764
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1273
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:15,433
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1274
01:54:15,517 --> 01:54:17,185
Here's your alibi.

1275
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:19,104
Okay.

1276
01:54:19,187 --> 01:54:21,356
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1277
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:23,608
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1278
01:54:23,692 --> 01:54:25,360
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1279
01:54:25,485 --> 01:54:28,613
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1280
01:54:28,697 --> 01:54:30,490
alone on the island.

1281
01:54:31,783 --> 01:54:33,034
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1282
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:35,287
Just read it, word for word.

1283
01:54:37,163 --> 01:54:39,207
There's nothing about Stane here.

1284
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:42,043
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1285
01:54:42,961 --> 01:54:45,380
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1286
01:54:45,505 --> 01:54:47,966
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1287
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:50,969
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1288
01:54:51,052 --> 01:54:53,388
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1289
01:54:53,471 --> 01:54:57,475
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1290
01:54:57,559 --> 01:54:59,811
You've got 90 seconds.

1291
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:04,357
Agent Coulson?

1292
01:55:05,025 --> 01:55:09,487
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1293
01:55:09,571 --> 01:55:12,532
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1294
01:55:12,741 --> 01:55:16,161
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1295
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:17,662
Right.

1296
01:55:18,580 --> 01:55:22,500
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1297
01:55:22,584 --> 01:55:24,878
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1298
01:55:24,961 --> 01:55:26,504
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1299
01:55:26,588 --> 01:55:29,049
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1300
01:55:29,132 --> 01:55:33,136
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1301
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:35,889
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1302
01:55:35,972 --> 01:55:38,224
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1303
01:55:38,308 --> 01:55:42,062
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1304
01:55:43,772 --> 01:55:44,814
crazy about me.

1305
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:46,566
Tell me you never think about that night.

1306
01:55:46,649 --> 01:55:48,568
- What night?
- You know.

1307
01:55:51,446 --> 01:55:57,243
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1308
01:55:58,912 --> 01:56:04,459
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1309
01:56:04,584 --> 01:56:07,796
and you left me there, by myself?

1310
01:56:09,005 --> 01:56:11,591
Is that the night you're talking about?

1311
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:14,803
Thought so.

1312
01:56:17,514 --> 01:56:21,267
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1313
01:56:21,351 --> 01:56:24,896
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1314
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:28,024
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1315
01:56:32,195 --> 01:56:37,325
Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1316
01:56:39,327 --> 01:56:42,330
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1317
01:56:42,455 --> 01:56:43,706
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1318
01:56:43,832 --> 01:56:46,584
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1319
01:56:46,668 --> 01:56:50,422
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1320
01:56:50,505 --> 01:56:53,633
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1321
01:56:53,716 --> 01:56:57,303
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1322
01:56:57,387 --> 01:57:00,640
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1323
01:57:00,723 --> 01:57:02,350
I never said you were a superhero.

1324
01:57:02,475 --> 01:57:07,814
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

1325
01:57:09,816 --> 01:57:13,027
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1326
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:16,531
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1327
01:57:16,656 --> 01:57:18,074
all the mistakes I've made,

1328
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:21,494
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1329
01:57:21,578 --> 01:57:23,246
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1330
01:57:25,373 --> 01:57:26,875
The truth is

1331
01:57:33,047 --> 01:57:34,549
I am Iron Man.

1332
02:05:37,782 --> 02:05:39,033
Jarvis!

1333
02:05:39,116 --> 02:05:40,868
Welcome home, sir.

1334
02:05:44,288 --> 02:05:49,794
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1335
02:05:50,127 --> 02:05:53,381
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1336
02:05:53,464 --> 02:05:55,257
You just don't know it yet.

1337
02:05:55,758 --> 02:05:57,551
Who the hell are you?

1338
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,471
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1339
02:06:02,556 --> 02:06:05,518
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger initiative.
